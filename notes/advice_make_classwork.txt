Start off right in classwork.
- Create a folder on Desktop or My Documents, for example, call it "classwork".
- Choose a text editor, NotePad++ for Windows or VIM for Mac.
- Decied on a command-line interpreter, Git Bash that 
comes with Git for Windows or Terminal for Mac.
- Git a Unix basic commands cheat sheet.

- "make" program is a building tool which runs on Unix and Linux.
- MinGW is a compiler system based on GNU (free UNIX-style OD) GCC that
compiles and links code to be run on Windows.

For Windows users: Edit System Environment Variable.
Say you have a executable called "file.exe", and it is located in "C:\Documents\". So the path to the executable is "C:\Documents\file.exe".

Now if you want to run this executable from command line, you can either:

- Go to that directory (`cd C:\Documents`), and run `.\file.exe`. Here, ".\" tells 
the command line interpreter that you want to run the file in "current directory". Or, Specify the full path to the executable --- Run `C:\Documents\file.exe` from any directory. 

- Or, Add "C:\Documents" to "PATH" environment variable. This tells the command line interpreter where to find a file 
if the command does not specify a path. With "C:\Documents" in "PATH", you can simply run "file.exe" from anywhere.

For SSH and FTP using Windows.
